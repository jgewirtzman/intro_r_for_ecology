# Intro to R for Ecology
The files here are a crash course in coding using the programming language R, and some applications for ecology. These resources were developed for the course BOT 315: Plant Ecology at Connecticut College in Spring 2024. 

The Intro2R tutorial is a generic introduction to syntax, objects, functions, data structures, plotting, and some basic analysis. This should be completed prior to other exercises.

The Community Ecology tutorial is an introduction to alpha and beta diversity, diversity indices, similiarity/dissimiliarty metrics and matrices, and ordination techniques. The tutorial uses data collected by students in BOT 315 (a tree inventory in the Connecticut College Arboretum) as an example to work through the different approaches to data analysis and visualization.

Feel free to use these resources (please cite the author), and suggest topics for future tutorials!

The tutorials are intended for students to run, by downloading the R Markdown files (.Rmd), along with relevant data contained in the "data/" folder, which can then be sourced to the scripts. These can then be run in chunks, along with some interactive portions where students are asked to generate their own code. However, the outputs fromm the tutorials (with generated plots, etc.) are also available as HTML files in this repo, as a quick (non-interactive) resource to read/study.

Happy coding!
